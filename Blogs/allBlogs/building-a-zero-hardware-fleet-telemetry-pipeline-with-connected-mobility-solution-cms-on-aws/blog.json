By leaning on those factory modems — rather than bolting-on aftermarket gateways — ARAMCO can ingest rich, near-real-time data straight into the AWS Cloud. The Connected Mobility Solution on AWS (CMS) gives you two drop-in modules that cover the critical first mile (ingest & storage) and the last mile (visualisation):\n\nAWS Documentation\n\nGitHub\n\nHigh-level Architecture\n\nHow the pieces fit together\n\nWhy this matters to business stakeholders\n\nAWS Documentation\n\nGitHub\n\nTypical Phase-1 rollout\n\nCall to action\n\nBy leveraging CMS’s pre-built modules, ARAMCO can stand up a production-grade connected-vehicle program without touching a single CAN bus or lifting a wrench. The result: faster insights, safer drivers, and a future-ready data foundation — delivered on AWS economics.\n\nReady to accelerate? Schedule your discovery session — together.\n\n© 2025 Solutions GSI — Global System Integrator, 24/7 AWS expertise",
