You can plug in RAG (Kendra or Bedrock Knowledge Bases), add guardrails, compare LLMs, and push to production with an enterprise-grade architecture. Typical costs range from ~$20/mo for the dashboard to ~$1.4K/mo for a high-scale RAG stack (plus knowledge base). (Amazon Web Services, Inc., AWS Documentation)\n\n# Why this solution (and when to use it)\n\nMost teams lose weeks wiring auth, WebSockets, prompt plumbing, RAG connectors, and observability before they even evaluate models. GAAB removes that heavy lifting so you can:\n\n# What you get out of the box\n\n# Architecture (visual walkthrough)\n\n# 1) Deployment Dashboard (admin experience)\n\nImage source: AWS Solutions docs. (AWS Documentation)\n\nKey components:\n\n# 2) Text Use Case (business user chat)\n\nImage source: AWS Solutions docs. (AWS Documentation)\n\nHighlights:\n\n# 3) Agent Use Case (agentic workflows)\n\nImage source: AWS Solutions docs. (AWS Documentation)\n\n# Regions and service availability\n\nGAAB is supported in a broad set of Regions (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-northeast-1, and more), but remember: Bedrock and Kendra aren’t in every Region. Launch in Regions where your required services exist (and confirm any non-AWS model APIs if you connect externally). (AWS Documentation)\n\n# Costs: what to expect (and how to keep control)\n\nUse AWS Budgets + Cost Explorer, and watch Bedrock token usage, Kendra tier, and logging verbosity. (AWS Documentation)\n\n# How to deploy (10 minutes)\n\n# Live demo & videos\n\n# Source code, docs, and images (for your Medium article)\n\nTip for Medium: paste the three architecture image URLs above directly into your story’s image blocks. Medium will fetch and embed them from docs.aws.amazon.com.\n\n# Customization & extensibility (what engineers will ask next)\n\n# Production checklist (save this)\n\n# Example user journeys\n\n# Performance & scale tips\n\n# Common pitfalls (and how to avoid them)\n\n# Ready to build?\n\nReady to accelerate?
